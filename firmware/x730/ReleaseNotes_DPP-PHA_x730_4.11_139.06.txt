  This file is x30 DPP-PHA FPGA firmware revision history.
  These digitizer boards houses two kinds of FPGA devices that are 
  configured with a single programming file:
    - ROC FPGA is the mainboard FPGA for communication and trigger handling.
    - AMC FPGA is the mezzanine FPGA for ADC and channel memory management:
      there are eight of them, but they are loaded with the same firmware image.
       
  Release numbers are in the form X.X_Y.Y, where X.X is the motherboard 
  FPGA release, while Y.Y is the channel mezzanine FPGA release.

===============================================================================
Release 4.11_139.06
===============================================================================
New Features / Changes	:

		* Removed Internal Pulse Emulator because of lack of internal resources in the FPGA

		* Added option to decide whether "bad events" (i.e. unmatched coincidence, vetoed, ect...) are discarded or tagged
   		  bit[19] of DppCtrl2 @ 0x1nA0: 0=discard, 1=tag with flag[7] = bit 23 of the energy word

Bug Fix			:

		* Bug Fix: energy cat at half range when NsPeak = 2 (num of samples for the peaking average)

		* Bug Fix: time stamp error at the roll-over of the 31 bit 
  
===============================================================================
Release 4.11_139.05
===============================================================================     
New Features / Changes	:

		* Added LE discriminator (set bit 6 of DppCtrl1 at 0x1n80)

		* Added CF discriminator (set bit 17 of DppCtrl1 at 0x1n80, previously used as "delta1" option; 

		* CFD fraction: bit [13:12] of DppCtrl2 at 0x1nA0): 00 = 25%, 01 = 50%, 10 = reserved, 11 = 100%

		* Register at address 0x1nD0 used to set the input baseline level (in ADC counts) for the CFD and LED

		* Added VETO with programmable width (0x1nD4 = set width in step of 8 ns; max value 0xFFFF;

		* Veto Source: 0x1nA0 - bit[15:14]: "00" = disabled, "01" = veto from trgin. "10" = veto from other channels, 
		  "11" = negative saturation (for TRP)

		* Modification: triggers occurring while the channel is busy or vetoed are not written to memory but still 
		  used to start the algorithms (trapezoid, baseline, etc...)
		* Changed busy LED driving: it lights up when a trigger is lost (trigger while busy=1, and not when the system is just busy)
		* Changed flags of the extras of Energy Word (bits from 16 to 31): bit0 = lost events (dead time), 
		  bit1 = roll-over, bit3 = fake event, bit4 = input saturation

		* Modified coincidence logic within the couples

		* Modified trigger individual validation/propagation settings (bit[5:4] @ 0x1n84): "00": from other channel in the couple, 
		  "01": from other couples (mother-board), "10": trg0 and trg1, "11": trg0 or trg1

		* Optimized timing for the internal control signals used to implement the coincidence logic

		* Added protection against wrong settings of the peaking time going beyond the flat-top (to prevent the FSM to wait for the peak value)

		* Added counters for total input triggers (ICR) and lost triggers: tick flags on Extras (extra_sel=2): bit[5] = lost trg, bit[6] = total trg.
    		  Tick rate: bit[17:16] of DppCtrl2 (@ 0x1nA0): "00" = 1 tick every 1024 triggers, "01" = every 128, "10" = every 8K

		* Completed the implementation of the decimation (it didn't work in the previous releases). Note: the decimation applies to the energy
    		  filter only: Decay Time (PZ-comp), Trap Rise Time and Flat Top. Timing filter (RC-CR2), baseline, hold-off, waveform length are not affected. 

		* Increased maximum record length from 32K to 128K samples (14 bit in the relevant register @ 0x1n20)

		* Changed format in energy word (32 bit): bit[14:0] = energy; bit[15] = PUR or SATUR; bit[31:16] = Extras (flags, as before) 
 
		* Reviewed input and trapezoid saturation management
 
		* Modified internal pulse emulator: now common to 4 channels and less options (modification needed to save FPGA resources)

		* Added option (sel=4) for the extra word: bit[15:0]=total trigger counter, bit[31:16]=lost trigger counter

		* Changed waveform dynamic range (mult by 2) of trapezoid and baseline. NOTE: it has no effect on the energy

		* Resized TTFdelay register (addr 0x1n58, 0x8058): 8 bit instead of 12 (12 bit was just wrong since max value is 255)
 
		* Changed behaviour of the Disable_SelfTrigger (bit 24 of DppCtrl1 @ 0x1n80): don't save events but generate trgout 

		* Implemented quad-range for the veto/gate window: VetoWidth register @1nD4: bit[17:16]=step, bit[15:0]=width_set
	    	  bit[17:16]: "00" step=8 ns; "01" step=2 us; "10" step=524 us; "11" step=134 ms

		* Changed baseline calculation: active also when the acquisition is not running. This allows the baseline to be immediately ready 
    		  after the start of run and prevents wrong energy caclulation in the first events. It is possible to go back to the old mode
    		  by setting the bit 18 of the DppCtrl2 register at 0x1nA0.

Bug Fix			:
	
		* Bug fix in coincidences
		* Bug fix in memory management: event data corrupted (the waveform looks rolled over)
		* Bug fix: in waveform mode, energy value not associated to the 1st pulse in the waveform
		* Bug fix: smoothing with 2 samples not available (option 0 = 1 sample; option 1 = 4 samples)
		* Bug fix: pulses exceeding the input dynamic range (clipped) where not acquired; now they are acquired and tagged as "saturated"
		* Bug fix: roll-over events discarded by coincidence logic
		* Bug fix in trigger hold-off; when lower than the time for the RC-CR2 to go from armed to zero crossing, the trigger was lost
    		  because at the end of the hold-off time the trigger was disarmed.
